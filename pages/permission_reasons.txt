The following permissions are required for the Chrome extension to function properly:

1. contextMenus: Allows the extension to create context menu items for copying page links and selected links.
2. activeTab: Enables the extension to interact with the currently active tab to access and copy links.
3. storage: Used to store user-defined filter rules and preferences for link filtering.
4. clipboardWrite: Permits the extension to copy filtered links to the user's clipboard.
5. scripting: Allows the extension to execute scripts in web pages to extract and process links.

Host Permissions:
1. <all_urls>: The extension needs access to all websites to scan web page content and extract links. This is essential for the core functionality of copying links from any webpage.
2. Privacy Protection: The extension only accesses the necessary information (links) and does not collect or store any personal data. All processing is done locally in the browser.
3. Security: The extension uses Chrome's sandboxing and permission system to ensure safe execution of scripts and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
